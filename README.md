# Meditations: dimzat | Reflection 
This was quite a fun and challenging project especially since flexbox made me want to rip my hair out in the beginning but now I feel much more comfortable using this tech. 
## The main takeaways from doing this project are as follows (in no particular order)
- Fluency in using flexbox
- Landing page design
- Different methods of achieving the same results in CSS
- In love with pinkpanthereses music
- Frustration in using CSS but rewarding experience
## Some improvements for the future
- Get to work faster. I spent about two months in a time waste purgatory but after putting my head down and focusing on the work, I completed this in less that a week
- Improve style.css format. I have no real clue as to what industry standard CSS looks like but I have attempted my best to stick to easy and short names for classes and followed DRY where applicable.
-  Drink more coconut water
